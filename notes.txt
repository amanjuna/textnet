what is style?
- the words you use, and how you use them
- content + connectivity = style

baseline approach:
    bag of words, connect words that have a certain cosine similarity

style comparison between style vectors:
- augment with Jaccard similarity
- dimensionality reduction, look for clustering

compare graph2vec and style graph?
